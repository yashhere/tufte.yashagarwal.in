[Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) is a popular course available on Coursera. It was on my bucket list for a very long time, but due to my reluctance and lackluster attitude, I avoided doing this course repeatedly.

In the last few months, I have come across a lot of amazing people who can generate new ideas consistently without breakinga a sweat. I found out that almost all of them read a lot. However, even I do that. Books, magazines, research papers, blogs, and what not. Then why am I not able to think through the existing material and improve upon them.

One reason, I thought is that some people are born with natural talent and capabilities to imagine out of the box. True, but not very useful for self-improvement. Self-doubt breeds demotivation and a dull attitude towards life. I am not going to fall for this trap.

Another reason is that even though I read a lot, I read more passively. I do not criticize the material enough. Simply reading and re-reading is not an excellent strategy to learn anything, and I do precisely this. I was getting knowledgable by reading, but because I did not put extra efforts in genuinely understanding the core of the content, I was not able to apply my knowledge in the real world. My mind was becoming more of a storehouse for facts.

This course promises to teach techniques which can help improve the retention capabilities of the mind. I thought that I might learn something from this course, so I decided to take this course. Here are my key takeaways from this course.

## Week 1

### Focused vs Diffused Mode

Focused mode is, what I used to think, *learning is*. It's when you are intently focused on some problem, trying to find a solution. Focused mode involves thinking on a single task. For example, you are reading this post right now and devoting your concentration to digest the material. The focused mode is often used when your brain already had an ingrained mental path on how to solve a particular problem.

The diffused mode happens when you are not focusing on something. The diffused mode is useful when you are working on some problem; you have never solved before. The best way to use diffused mode is to take a break from the problem and do something else, not related to the problem at all.

Effective learning happens at the crossover of these two modes of thinking. You should allow your brain to focus on a problem for some time and then take a break and let the thoughts spread out. So, after an intense period of focused studying, take breaks, play some sport, go for a walk, meditate, or think about other things. And do not feel bad about it. You are giving your diffused mind opportunity to do its work in the best possible way. 

### Beat Procrastination
**Learning a new thing or doing something you would rather not do can be stressing, your brain starts searching for something easier and pleasant. It finds something that you always find enjoyable. It works, but once you come back to your original work, you get upset at the fact that you got distracted.**

The course suggests to just start with the problem. Researchers discovered that not long after people start actually working out what they didn’t like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared. It is a fact that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.

The Pomodoro Technique is a effective technique to counter this problem. In Pomodoro technique, you decide on a task to be done and set a timer. For the length of the timer, you work on that task without getting interrupted. Even when you face some difficulty in solving the problem, you keep working on it until the timer is over.

Pomodoro technique consists of session lengths of 25 minutes with small breaks of 5 minutes afterward. During the break, you can do anything before starting the next 25-minute session. Don't forget to reward yourself for staying focused for 25 minutes. (web surfing, coffee, streching, music etc.)

I tried this technique, and I can vouch for it. I am using [Goodtime](https://github.com/goodtime-productivity/Goodtime) app on Android. It is open source application. If you download it from [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.adrcotfas.goodtime), you will have to pay for premium features, so I downloaded it from [FDroid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.apps.adrcotfas.goodtime), where its full version is available for free.

You can't predict if you will be able to solve every problem that arises in a day, but you can control how much time and effort you put in. Pomodoro technique helps in making sure that you get enough focused time for fixing the issues.

### Memory
There are two types of memory systems - working memory and long term memory. Working memory is the part of memory, which helps with what you are currently processing in your mind. The working memory is like a blackboard, but not a good one. You need to remind yourself constantly what you are working on so that it stays in your memory.

The long term memory, is like a storehouse. When we first try to put something in long term memory, we need to repeat it at specific intervals for it to persist.

When you encounter something, you often use your working memory. To move this information in long term memory, it takes time and practice. *Spaced Repetition* is a technique which can help with this process. It involves practicing something in small time intervals, and as you get perfect in it, increase the amount of time between each interval.

**To help in retaining information, I find taking notes very useful. As soon as you read something, take short notes. Getting involved with people and explaining them something is a great way to retain and understand information. Rubberducking is also a useful technique, although I find it difficult to use at times.**

> I think that the Spaced Repetition technique is more useful with discrete pieces of informations, for example learning new vocabulary words, but it does not work well with lengthy informations, such as blog posts and research papers. I am still struggling with my retention ability in this area. If you use any technique that works well for you, please let me know.

For something abstract like Math/Science concepts, the trick is to practice at repeated intervals to strengthen the neural connection to make it easier to recall.

### Sleep better
Sleep is an important part of learning. Sleep allows your mind to wash away toxins. During sleep, your brain tidies up the new ideas and concepts you are thinking about and learning. Sleep helps in repairing old neural connections and building new ones. When sleeping, your brain erases old, less important parts of memory and simultaneously strengthen the parts that you want to remember or learn. Sleep also helps in improving your ability to figure out solutions to difficult problems and to understand what you are trying to learn.

Sleep is perhaps the best way to utilize the abovementioned diffused mode of thinking. However, before you can engage the diffused mode, you need to do the focus mode work. It is shown that if you go over whatever you are learning, just before the night sleep or a nap, you have an increased chance of dreaming about it. Dreaming about something that you are currently studying enhances your ability to understand. It somehow consolidates your memories into easier to grasp chunks, and now, time for a little sleep.

### Other ideas
- We learn best by doing and by osmosis from people who are experts in their fields.
- Just reading a lot of books is not effective. Taking notes while you read is a good idea.
- Try to be active while reading some material. Marking up a book and actively thinking about various questions about the book content (structure, the arguments being made, the theme, the main ideas, etc) is important.
- Exercise is a great way to consolidate whatever you have learnt.
- Ideally, you want to be surrounded by other people who are stimulating you and your thinking.
- Rereading and highlighting (on their own) are less effective for learning.

## Week 2

### Chunking
Chunks are the pieces of information, which bond together using meaning. Chunking helps in remembering the main idea. It helps in grouping similar concepts into compact bundles of information that are easier for mind to recall.

Just memorizing a fact without understanding or context doesn't help you understand what's really going on or how the concept fits together with other concepts you're learning.

#### How to form chunks
- Listen and watch to get a basic understanding of the material. In Math and Science, it helps to start with a worked out example. It helps in seeing the underlying principles in the problem. But do not focus on individual steps just now. Just focus on the connections between the steps.
- Turn off all the distractions and give your undivided attention to the material.
- Figure out what the main idea is, by using both the modes. See if you can summarise the material without any trouble.
- Without understanding the material, it is unlikely that you will be able to form the chunk.
- Develop context, so that you know not just *how* but also *when* to use the chunk. Practicing the content can help.

Just because, you can understand how a problem was solved, does not mean that you can solve the problem yourself. *Don't confuse the aha! of a breakthrough and understanding with solid expertise.* That's why, you can grasp an idea when a teacher presented in class, but if you don't review it fairly soon after you first learned it, it can seem incomprehensible when it comes time to prepare for a test. 

In math and science related subjects, closing the book and testing yourself on whether you yourself can solve the problem you think you understand will speed up your learning at this stage. You often realize the first time you actually understand something is when you can actually do it yourself.

**Bottom-up chunking** - Practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily access it whenever you need to. **(How to do)**

**Top-down chunking** - Allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in. **(When to use)**

#### Tips
- Doing a rapid two-minute picture walk through a chapter in a book before you begin studying it, glancing at pictures and section headings can allow you to gain a sense of the big picture.
- Learn the major concepts or points first, then fill in the details.

### Recall
You have read almost half of this article till now. What has stood the most for you?

Do not scroll back. Pause for a moment and try to *recall*.

Recalling is a practice of bringing back the information in your mind, that you have just read. After you've read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you've just read. Retrieval process helps in enhacing our understanding of concepts and formation of chunks.

Concepts maps will not work very effectively, because you are trying to build connection between different chunks before the basic chunks are embedded in the brain.

Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make your study time more focused and effective. The only time rereading text seems to be effective, is if you let time pass between the rereading, so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition.

Practicing recall is useful, becuase it helps in avoiding illusion of competence. Illusion of competence is a feeling that you know everything about some material, while in reality, you do not understand the material in depth. Recalling and describing the concepts in your own words is a way to figure out which parts you understand, and which you don't.

### Be wary of Einstellung
Einstellung is a phenomenon, when some older thought in your mind, prevents new ideas and patterns from developing in your mind. The danger of becoming an expert in some field, might prevent you from thinking from an amateur's perspective. Expertise in your field, can make you blind towards some fundamental aspects of the problem.

Whenever you are learning some thing new, learn it with open mind, and do not be afraid of asking stupid questions. Remeber, there's no such thing as a stupid question.

### Practice Interleaving
Mastering some new subject means understanding different concepts of that subjects and the ability to apply these different concepts together. One way to do this is to jumping back and forth between different problems that require use of different concepts or techniques.

Interleaving different concepts in your studies can sometimes make the learning a little more difficult, but it helps you learn more deeply.

When interleaving is done between different concepts of one single subject, it helps you strengthen the concepts, but when the interleaving is done between different subjects, it helps in makiing connections between different ideas for seemingly different fields.

> Developing expertise in several fields means you can bring very new ideas from one field to the other, but it can also mean that your expertise in one field or the other isn't quite as deep as that of the person who specializes in only one discipline. On the other hand, if you develop expertise in only one discipline, you may know it very deeply but you may become more deeply entrenched in your familiar way of thinking and not be able to handle new ideas.


## Week 3 -- Procrastination and Memory

### Habits
Your willpower is a limited resource. The more you use it early in the day, difficult it will become to do your works rest of the day. Wasting willpower to fight procrastination is a lost cause.

Habits can help with this. If you can form habits for our daily activities, then you can free your mind from thinking in focused manner about what you're doing.

Habits can be broken into four parts -

1. Cue - An event which triggers the next three parts. Let us take an example of getting a text message from your friend.
2. Routine - What happens when you are triggered by the cue. You check your phone.
3. Reward - Following the routine gives you feelings of pleasure.
4. Belief - Habits have power because of your underlying belief in them. In this example, you believe that you will never be able to change this habit because you are easily distracted by your surroundings.

So, how do you change a *bad* habit?

Remove the cue and the rest of the parts will crumble. What if your phone was in different room. You will never trigger the cue and consequently rest of the parts.

If you want to create good habits, follow the four steps -

1. Create a cue
2. Make good routine around the cue.
3. Give yourself reward, if you follow through.
4. Slowly, you’ll start forming a belief about you being the type of person who has the good habit.

### Process vs Product
