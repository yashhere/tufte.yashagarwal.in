    "My Review": "Reading this book has changed my perspective on a lot of topics. I learned how to think from a different ideological perspective. Despite being young (therefore rebellious by nature), I have been a centrist with an inclination towards the right for a long time now. However, this book has given me good clarity about the left and their contributions/misadventures in the young republican.<br/><br/>The book can be divided into three parts - the Nehru era, the Indira era, and the rest. Most of the other reviews here have already mentioned the bias of the author towards the initial leadership of Congress. In one of the places, Mr. Guha tries to justify it by saying that the material available for the very recent past is very scarce. Also, the biases of the writer influence him when the time in consideration, is also close to him.<br/><br/>I did not like the description of events after the 1990s, but given the lack of enough resources and the slow pace of time concerning history, I think he has done an excellent job.<br/><br/>The author ignored certain vital events in the modern history of India. Some of the following that I recall are -<br/>1. Addition of words \"socialist\" and \"secular\" by Indira Gandhi in the 42nd amendment.<br/>2. Influence of Bollywood and other film industries on the Indian public.<br/>3. Cricket",

    "My Review": "I am very interested in Indian political events, so this book was quite an engaging read for me. I might be little biased here, but the book was very well written, though editing could be improved at some places, especially in the first few chapters of the book.<br/><br/>This book's premise loosely based on the media reports that claimed a particular political party's involvement in the Pulwama attack on the Indian security forces, to gain an advantage in the upcoming Indian elections. The author has done excellent work taking these allegations for the idea of the book. It was quite easy to correlate the characters of the book to their real-life counterparts. The names selected for the roles also bear a striking similarity to the real-life characters. The businessman's name was unique, though (or I think so).<br/><br/>It was strange that the plan to declare war on the neighbor did not face any opposition from anyone. Almost every character supported the decision, and the kind of support India received from the international community was something, I do not anticipate in real life. But then, it is a work of fiction, and the author had the liberty to assume whatever he wishes to.<br/><br/>It was a predictable story after a few chapters in the beginning. I would have liked to have some unexpected events such as the early death of some of the characters to keep the story more engaging.<br/><br/>The ending was apt. It signifies the fact that sometimes influential people start doing things which are wrong but carries good intentions according to them. It is nearly impossible to bring down such influential people sitting on higher posts, once they have people's mandate.",

    "My Review": "A good book. But I felt that the author sometimes explained concepts in a straightforward language without assuming any prerequisite from the reader, and sometimes he used some ideas which required some basic primer before use. The first half of the book was an easy read for me, but the latter half was relatively difficult to understand. One of the reasons that I can think of is that I have not studied the advancements in Physics after WWII during my school. So I did not have a basic understanding of the concepts.<br/><br/>It is one of those books, which will make you feel intelligent and dumb at the same time, still, definitely worth a read.",

    "My Review": "I started this book with rough experience with self-help guides. However, this book has changed my belief, or shall I say, this book shook my views completely. I was able to relate to whatever Mark told in this book. All those thoughts and beliefs which were part of my subconscious but I never tried to realize, this book has brought all of them to the surface, and I am grateful for this realization. I still have a \"long\" journey to cover, and I hope that this timely realization will prove to be useful for me. This book undoubtedly deserves one more reading.",

    "My Review": "This book has changed something about my thought process. I learned many new and cruel things about humankind. Notably, the repeated mentions and descriptions about animal husbandry were disturbing. This book excels in telling various side stories that were conveniently ignored by the Human Historians till now. They say, winners, get to write the history. From an Indian perspective, this book talks very little about Asia and in particular India, Hinduism, and Indus Valley Civilization. As far as I remember, there are only one or two mentions of this civilization. If not most magnificent, Indus Valley Civilization should get an equal place to its contemporary cultures. But this book fails to give that place.<br/><br/>The description of Modern civilization and its side-effects on the other animal is worrying. The author was successful in provoking my thought process. The science fiction like predictions is worth noting. Although these predictions should be taken a pinch of salt, they might prove to be correct, if history takes the author's intended course of direction.<br/><br/>All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.",
